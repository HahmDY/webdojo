As urbanization progresses, we are gradually becoming disconnected from nature. However, we are part of nature, and protecting it means protecting ourselves. Start with small actions. Reducing single-use items, saving energy, and participating in environmental cleanup. These small efforts collectively can make our Earth more beautiful. Nature teaches us many things: patience, cycles, and harmonious ways of living. We can learn from nature and create a better future together. From this moment on, embrace a heart that loves and protects nature. When we protect nature, nature will protect us in return."
